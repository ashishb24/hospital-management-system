# _hospital management system_

### Introduction

   _An appointment management system is a software used by companies and service
providers to streamline their service appointments. By using the system, potential
customers can know and choose their preferred appointment times according to the
companies and service providers' available time slots. This project does not include
a B2C marketplace-like interface for customers to browse different service providers._

### Requirements

_• Created a login system for users to register an account with the system. You may add
social logins like Google or Facebook to enhance the sign-up/sign in user experience._

_• Used a third party JavaScript library or plugin to display a calendar with the available
time slots for selected time periods (e.g. a week)._

_• A business side admin dashboard for businesses to manage available appointment times and
future appointments._

_• A customer interface where customers can schedule, view, or cancel their appointments with
a business._

_• Used the simplest scheduler (cron job) to send customers email reminders prior to their
appointments._
